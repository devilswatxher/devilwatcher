    <h3>1.Hell's pardise</h3>
    <p>Hell's Paradise has been one of the most popular anime projects of 2023 thus far. The show recently concluded its debut season with Episode 13, "Dreams and Reality," ending on a cliffhanger revealing a new character. Fans of the series have praised the project for its slick action sequences, creative use of gore, unique visuals and unexpected moments. It is also firmly connected to Jujutsu Kaisen and Chainsaw Man as a member of the "Dark Shonen Trio," a new collection of influential modern animanga properties.</p>

    <h3>3.Solo Leveling</h3>
    <p>In a world where hunters, humans who possess magical abilities, must battle deadly monsters to protect the human race from certain annihilation, a notoriously weak hunter named Sung Jinwoo finds himself in a seemingly endless struggle for survival. One day, after narrowly surviving an overwhelmingly powerful double dungeon that nearly wipes out his entire party, a mysterious program called the System chooses him as its sole player and in turn, gives him the extremely rare ability to level up in strength, possibly beyond any known limits. Jinwoo then sets out on a journey as he fights against all kinds of enemies, both man and monster, to discover the secrets of the dungeons and the true source of his powers.</p>
